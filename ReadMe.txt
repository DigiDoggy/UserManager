The program is a user management program that is designed to work with data of users who have registered on a website. It allows the user to create, view, update, and delete user information such as name, birthdate, city, and email. The program is written in Java and utilizes an ArrayList to store the user information.

The program has a menu-driven interface that is displayed in the terminal. The user can choose from the following options:

1.Show all users - This option displays a list of all registered users and allows the user to select a specific user to view more information about.

2.Create a user - This option allows the user to add a new user to the system. The program checks that the entered email is valid and that the name does not start with numbers or spaces.

3.Update user - This option allows the user to edit and update existing user information.

4.Delete user - This option allows the user to delete existing users from the system.

5.Exit - This option exits the program.
